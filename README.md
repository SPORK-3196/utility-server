# About Utility Server #
Utility Server is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server that Team SPORK uses to host and operate our workshop intranet.

### Setup ###
* Install Linux
  * We use Ubuntu running on an old desktop, but Raspbian on a Pi works well also
* Install Apache, PHP, and MySQL
* Place the Server source files in /var/www/html/ directory
  * Alternatively, it is possible to use a symbolic link to the repository
